# example
A working "sidecar" type application that pushes files from a monitored directory into the configured Kafka topic.
My goals were to make the code as concise and readable as possible.
Also served as a opportunity to play with several of the new features of Java 8 (lambdas in particular.) 

Note: there's no build file provided; developed using the free community edition of IntelliJ. If you want to build it you can simply download the IDE and import it.
